## A02_QuizGUI

I successfully developed a quiz application targeted at elementary school students using Java Swing. The application featured a range of GUI components, including checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown boxes, and lists, and presented the user with 5 elementary-level math questions. I designed the program architecture with an abstract class called Components, which served as a template for all other GUI components, making the system modular and easy to expand or modify. The quiz also incorporated an acknowledgment checkbox to ensure academic honesty, a requirement before students could submit their quiz and view their performance summary.
